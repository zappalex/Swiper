# Swiper
A simple app that allows the user to responsibly keep track of daily expenses

When making daily purchases with a credit card, it is often easy to lose track of expenses and how they impact your budget ( whatever it may be ).  When using cash,  a person is forced to pay greater attention to each expense.  Swiper is an intentionally simple app that was built to bridge this gap and promote greater accountability and responsibility when making daily purchases with a credit card.  

Swiper is a very simple app, and really just an excuse to play around with widgets (though i use it daily) .
